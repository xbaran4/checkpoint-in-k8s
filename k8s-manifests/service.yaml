  # TODO: Since checkpointers will run on each node, when a request to checkpointer container A comes to this service,
  # it needs to be forwarded to the specific Node (kubelet on the Node) that runs the container A.
  # Optionally it could broadcast the request to all nodes, and the request would succeed only on the Node running A.
  # This however would require logic outside of the k8s Service resource.
